        <h3><p>Hello World. My name is Lupe Acosta. I have been married for 22 years to my husband Alex. We have three wonderful children. They are ages 29, 20, and 16. Now that my kids are practically grown, I have decided to go back to school to work on obtaining my CIS Certificates.
        Being my own boss has granted me the opportunity to have the best of both worlds; Being able to stay home and spend time with my kids as well as making my own schedule. I enjoy refurnishing furniture, diy projects and traveling. </p></h3>
